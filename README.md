## Compatibility Notes

This SFZ Instrument is reconstructed with the heavily use of SFZ specification Cakewalk. With this is mind, this 
instrument will only played properly in SFZ samplers that used Cakewalk Engine. Trying to play this 
instrument in non-Cakewalk based SFZ samplers may cause issues and problems if it doesn't support the opcodes superset 
used in this SFZ instrument. If Cakewalk-based SFZ sampler is not your choice, we recommend looking back at the original 
repositories of this fork.

## Usage Tips

- If you are an advanced user and well understand this SFZ format, you can also modify anything in this sfz instrument to your 
personal taste, make new presets and settings that suit to your private need. SFZ is an easy-to-learn format and very editable. 
However, if you use this SFZ as your basis to create a new one and want to distribute it, we just ask to explicitly put a note that 
it's derived from this sfz instrument in this github repository.
